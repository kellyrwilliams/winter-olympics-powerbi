# winter-olympics-powerbi
For this project, I was tasked with using a data set to create an interactive dashboard in Power BI. I used Winter Olympics data that required joining a few tables together.

With this dashboard, I wanted a better understanding of what age, gender or nationality trends I could find across the top-peforming athletes. In general, my conclusions were that the larger the country, the more even split there was between male and female athletes. Additionally, there seemed to be a larger age spread btween males compared to that of females. 

There were a few countries that stood out to me in this data set, however. China and Japan had the highest number of athletes for the region, but a majority of the gold medals came from females, unlike most of the other countries that had more gold medals from male athletes. Ukraine, Poland and Slovenia were the only other countries that mirrored this trend.
